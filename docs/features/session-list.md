# Session list: grouping, cron jobs, branch nesting, delete & swipe polish (#24, #34, #73)

Normative invariants moved out of `CLAUDE.md` (2026-08-14 restructure). The short rules live in
`CLAUDE.md` → "Session list"; this doc is the full contract. Design history:
`docs/plans/completed/`.

## Grouping & archived

Session-list grouping is a persisted UI pref (`SessionGroupingMode`: `.workspace` /
`.chronological`) in `PreferencesClient` — display-only over the one fetched `sessions` array
(no fetch/order change), reset on logout. The list is a flat `.listStyle(.plain)`; grouping
options + the **Archived sessions** entry live in a top-trailing `Menu`; "New chat" is a bottom
bar via **`.safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom)`** (a `.bottomBar` toolbar renders blank in the
snapshot host). **Archived** is a server query (`?archived=only`) shown in a sheet
(`ArchivedSessionsFeature`); restore = `archive(id, false)`; tap-to-open bubbles up the existing
`openSession` delegate.

## Cron sessions & the Cron Jobs section (#24)

**Cron sessions** (`source == "cron"`, decoded onto `Session` via `SessionListDTO`) are pulled
into an **always-on, separate "Cron Jobs" section** — orthogonal to the grouping mode (no new
`SessionGroupingMode` case). The partition lives in the reducer's computed state (`cronSessions`
vs the non-cron `interactiveSessions` that feeds
`pinnedSessions`/`groups`/`chronologicalSessions`), so cron rows never appear in
Pinned/workspace/chronological. Rendered with a `clock`-icon header below the interactive
sections, and **not shown during search** (search stays flat).

**The Cron Jobs section groups runs under their *jobs*, desktop-style**: `GET /api/cron/jobs` is
fetched sequentially INSIDE the session-load effect (after `.profileSessionsResponse` or
`.unscopedSessionsResponse`, same CancelID —
deterministic TestStore order, no racy merge); a run session binds to its job via the
id-embedded prefix (`cron_{job_id}_{ts}` → `CronJob.jobID(fromSessionID:)`) — upstream has a
`/runs` endpoint, but the client groups from the already-fetched sessions so **older agents work
too**. Job rows: state pip (**green live / amber paused** — deliberately NOT the accent, which
is orange and would be indistinguishable from amber; red error, gray inactive),
`relativeRunLabel` next-run countdown off `state.now` (poll-refreshed — no per-second ticker),
unread dot judged over ALL the job's runs (not just the peeked 5), and a context menu (Run now /
Pause / Resume → `cronActionInFlightIDs` double-fire guard; success refetches — full load after
trigger, jobs-only for pause/resume; **no optimistic job-state mutation**). Tap = single-open
inline peek (`expandedCronJobID`) of the newest `cronPeekLimit` runs via the standard `row(_:)`;
runs matching no fetched job render flat below (`unmatchedCronSessions` — never hide output).
The header carries the aggregate `cronUnreadCount` badge; cron sessions use the same shared
server-backed unread state as interactive rows (with the legacy device-local `seenCounts`
fallback below). **Capability-gated**: a 404 flips
`cronJobsSupported` off → flat run list, fetch skipped thereafter; transient failures keep the
previous jobs (no flapping). Jobs are fetched with the LITERAL selected profile name when
`profilesSupported` (matching the scoped session list, so a job's runs are actually present),
unscoped otherwise.

## Shared pin membership, local order

`Session.pinned` is an optional server membership flag shared with Desktop; pin order stays
**device-local** in `PreferencesClient.pinnedIDs`. Only a successful, current **profile-scoped
list** reconciles membership: explicit `true` adds an ID, explicit `false` removes it except
while protected by migration or a same-profile pending write, and missing/null preserves it.
Existing insertion order is retained; new server pins append in response order. Absent IDs
are not pruned; duplicate rows use the first occurrence. Search and unscoped responses never
establish pin ownership or reconcile membership. The local ID cache is device-global, not a
profile-ownership record.

**Migrate before accepting server unpins.** Freeze legacy local IDs before importing server
pins, with a durable checkpoint per server URL (trailing-slash normalized, independent of
bearer-token changes). Pending IDs remain protected from server `false`; upload them only
when trusted current-profile rows advertise explicit pin capability. Absent/nil rows remain
pending. Checkpoint each successful upload separately; failures retain pending IDs for a
later eligible list response to retry. Locally removed IDs retire only after no pin/removal
operation can roll back. An empty checkpoint records completion; identity-pref clearing also
clears migration checkpoints. Completion must match the server, checkpoint, mutation and
attempt identity, and must never restore old pin or row snapshots.

**Ownership precedes capability.** With profiles support, Pin/Unpin and its UI affordances
require a non-search list whose provenance matches the selected profile. Search remains
unscoped: selected profile, session ID, source string, cached membership, or an explicit pin
flag cannot prove ownership. Modern search/unscoped/wrong-profile rows cannot write or fall
back locally. For eligible rows:

- Explicit `pinned` writes `{"pinned": true/false, "profile": "<selected name>"}` via
  `PATCH /api/sessions/{id}`. Always pass the literal profile, including `"default"`, in
  query and body rather than inheriting the server's active profile.
- Missing/null `pinned` keeps Pin/Unpin device-local, per row; mixed responses still allow
  server writes for explicit rows. There is no global pin-capability downgrade.
- Without profiles support, Pin/Unpin stays device-local, including legacy search rows.
  Both local fallback paths persist synchronously without PATCH, server-mutation bookkeeping,
  or fetch invalidation.

All paths require an existing row with no same-ID pin/archive/delete operation in flight.
**Writes are serialized per ID, not globally**; unrelated rows remain actionable. Server
writes optimistically persist membership. Failure restores only that ID's membership and
order, using ordering anchors for overlapping unpins rather than a stale preference snapshot.
Newer authoritative membership from another profile prevents an old-context rollback.

Fetch profile/query/generation checks reject stale results and wrong-context ownership.
Same-profile pending writes are protected during reconciliation. A user write invalidates
and cancels the fetch without losing pending refresh intent; success or failure invalidates
stale responses again and restarts a pending current-context list or active search. Migration
completion likewise invalidates stale fetches and restarts a pending load/search.

**Same-ID removal is rejected while a pin write (including migration) is pending**, before
local removal, preference persistence, cache/slot delegates, or REST effects. Main-list
archive/delete confirmation and archived-sheet delete show “Wait for the pin change to
finish, then try again.” The parent delegate also guards removal, and the sheet mirrors
pending pin IDs on presentation and write start/completion. After completion, a new removal
attempt is allowed; removal is never queued automatically.

## Shared unread state

On agents that return the optional `unread` field, the backend owns read state: its
`last_read_at` watermark is shared with Desktop, so opening a row on either client clears the
other client's dot on its next poll, and later server activity raises it everywhere. Mobile
PATCHes `{"unread": false}` on **every** open—even when the row already says false—because false
also represents an untracked legacy row (`last_read_at == NULL`); the first acknowledgement is
what makes later activity observable. A completion received while the chat remains visible
acknowledges again after the new activity, so the reply being watched is not rediscovered as
unread on Desktop. The write is optimistic and best-effort: a failed PATCH is reconciled by the
next authoritative list poll.

Older agents omit `unread`. For those rows only, mobile preserves its existing device-local
`seenCounts` behavior (`message_count > last seen`), including first-sight seeding. This is a
per-row fallback—not a server-wide capability latch—so mixed/transitional responses stay safe.

## Branch nesting is display-only (#34)

`parent_session_id` decodes leniently from REST onto `Session.parentSessionID`
(`trimmedNonEmpty`); pure `flattenSessionsWithBranches` (desktop algorithm — sibling recency
sort, group-recency lift, recursion, cycle-safe, trailing sweep, **`byVisibleID` lineage
aliasing**: `_lineage_root_id` → `Session.lineageRootID` keeps a branch nested after its parent
auto-compresses and the row id rotates to the continuation tip) runs per rendered lane (pinned /
workspace / chronological) after the cron partition, emitting `└─`/`├─` stems. Recency is
`updatedAt ?? .distantPast` — deliberately the SAME rule the lanes sort by (no desktop
`started_at` fallback), so nesting never reorders flat rows. Orphans (parent absent from the
lane) de-nest — never hidden; the Pinned lane keeps pin order (`sortTopLevelByRecency: false`; a
pinned branch nests only when its parent is also pinned, otherwise it de-nests); search /
archived / cron stay flat. Row identity and swipe/context affordances are unchanged.

## Session delete (#73)

**Delete is permanent and server-side**: REST `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}` (+`?profile=` per
the per-call scoping rule in `docs/architecture.md`, same as archive), idempotent upstream (`already_absent`
is success by contract; a ghost row never 404s). The main-list flow **mirrors archive exactly**:
`deleteButtonTapped` raises a `ConfirmationDialogState` ("This permanently deletes the session
and its history."), `confirmDelete` captures a full rollback payload (session + index + pin
index + seen count), removes optimistically, inserts into the **`deletingIDs` in-flight guard**
(fetch/poll results filter out `archivingIDs ∪ deletingIDs` — either window can resurrect a
removed row), sends `delegate.sessionDeleted` FIRST, and cancels the in-flight fetch before
running the RPC. A transient failure rolls back per **`rollBackFailedRemoval`** (the ONE
rollback rule, shared with archive) and sets the "Couldn't delete the session." banner. The
rule is deliberately asymmetric: the **pin + seen metadata is ALWAYS restored and
persisted** (both live under device-global prefs keys keyed by session id — not
profile-scoped — so skipping them would lose the pin/unread baseline for a session the
server kept), while the **row re-insert applies only when the list still shows the same
context the RPC was issued under** — same profile scope AND same raw search query (the
failure action carries both). A profile mismatch means a cross-profile row that opens under
the wrong scope; a query mismatch means the saved index points into a different result set,
and the poll is paused while searching so the wrong-query row would stick. A skipped
re-insert self-heals: the original context's next fetch returns the still-existing row. On
success the list emits `delegate.sessionDeleteSucceeded` — the confirmation delegate,
distinct from the optimistic `sessionDeleted`. Success also **cancels-or-restarts** the
shared fetch (`cancelOrRestartFetch`, shared with archive/rename success): a bare cancel of
a fetch that was actually pending (`isLoading`, or an active search — the poll is paused
while searching) would strand a stuck spinner / stale search results, so the current-context
fetch restarts instead and lands an authoritative post-RPC response. A **cleared search**
(trimmed-empty `searchQuery` binding) reloads immediately via `load` rather than the 300ms
search debounce — `load` raises `isLoading`, which is what keeps that pending reload visible
to `cancelOrRestartFetch` (the debounced search effect raises no flag, and with the query
empty `isSearching` no longer covers the window). Delete is offered on every row variant
(pinned, cron runs, branch children) — all sections funnel through the one `row(_:)` builder.

**Capability gate — the 405 wrinkle**: `deleteSupported` defaults `true` and flips off lazily
on a definitive verdict from an actual delete (no pre-probe). The verdict is `.notFound` **or**
`.server(status: 405)` — on older agents the path `/api/sessions/{id}` already exists for
`PATCH`/`GET`, so an unsupported `DELETE` returns **405 Method Not Allowed**, not the usual
404. Both flip the flag **silently** (row restored, NO banner — mirror the other silent
capability flips) and hide every Delete affordance plus the Settings row from then on. The flag
mirrors **both ways** with the archived sheet: the sheet's `deleteSupported` is seeded from the
list's flag on present, and a verdict inside the sheet mirrors back via
`ArchivedSessionsFeature.Delegate.deleteUnsupported`.

**`AppFeature` on `sessionDeleted`**: ALWAYS wipe the session's cached snapshot + turn anchor
(`ChatSnapshotClient.deleteSnapshot(sessionID:)`) — a deleted session must never repaint from
the non-authoritative cache. When the deleted id matches the live-chat slot, tear it down too
with **`teardownSlot(flushSnapshot: false)`** — skipping the `persistNow` flush is the point:
the flush would re-save the very snapshot the wipe deletes. Every other teardown keeps the
flush. Archive and delete both pass `thenFill: detailRefill(state)`, which reseats the
regular-width detail column and is `nil` in compact (`docs/features/ipad-layout.md`).
Same deliberate asymmetry as archive: if the DELETE later fails, the list restores the
row but the slot and cache stay cleared — re-opening simply resumes the session fresh.
The **pending-approval badge entry is the exception**: it's dropped on
`sessionDeleteSucceeded` (server-confirmed), NOT at initiation — a failed delete leaves the
approval pending on the server, and nothing short of a fresh approval push would repopulate
a prematurely-cleared entry.

**Archived-sheet delete is immediate — no confirmation (deliberate)**: those sessions are
already tucked away and the sheet is the bulk-cleanup surface. Same optimistic shape as
restore (`deletingIDs` guard, rollback + banner on transient failure, refresh-during-delete
exclusion). **The DELETE round-trip runs in the PARENT list, not the sheet**: a presented
child's effects are cancelled when the sheet is dismissed (`ifLet` semantics), so a
sheet-run DELETE racing Done/swipe-down would be silently dropped after the cache and badge
were already updated. The sheet bubbles `Delegate.deleted(id:session:index:)` FIRST (with
the rollback payload); the list forwards it as its own `sessionDeleted` (so `AppFeature`
applies the same snapshot wipe + slot teardown as a main-list delete — an archived session
CAN be the live slot: opening one from the sheet resumes it without un-archiving, and
another client can archive the slot's session out from under this device; the wipe stays
even if the DELETE later fails), threads the sheet's `profileName` into the RPC, and
**re-injects `deleteSucceeded`/`deleteFailed` only while the SAME sheet presentation still
owns the delete**: the round-trip is stamped with `archivedSheetGeneration` (bumped on
every present) and the outcome must match the current generation AND find the id in the
sheet's `deletingIDs` guard. The id alone is ambiguous — after a dismiss-and-reopen the
same session can be deleted AGAIN, and re-injecting the first request's late failure would
clear the new operation's guard and resurrect its row while the second request's real
outcome then has nowhere to land. A dismissed sheet, a re-opened one's fresh fetch, and a
stale-generation outcome all route to the list instead. With the sheet gone, a verdict
still flips the list's `deleteSupported` (server-wide) and a transient failure surfaces the
list's banner; success always emits `sessionDeleteSucceeded`. Inside the sheet, a completed
delete restarts (not bare-cancels) a listing fetch still in flight — same stale-response
resurrection window as the main list, and the sheet has no poll to self-heal a stranded
spinner.

## Swipe default, row polish & confirmation presentation (#73)

**The default swipe action is a device-local pref**: `SessionSwipeAction` (`archive` |
`delete`, `.archive` default) persisted via `PreferencesClient`, reset in **all three logout
recipes** (Settings clear-token, retry-screen logout, reauth quit). Views must read the
computed **`effectiveSwipeAction`**, which clamps back to `.archive` while
`!deleteSupported` — the stored pref survives the clamp, so it re-activates if a capable agent
returns. Settings exposes a "Default swipe action" `Picker`, rendered only when
`deleteSupported` (the flag is passed in when presenting the sheet); a change persists and
bubbles a delegate so the list mirrors the value immediately.

**Trailing swipe order is destructive-first**: [default action (Archive or Delete per
`effectiveSwipeAction`, destructive, listed FIRST), Rename]. SwiftUI places the first listed
button nearest the edge and makes it the **full-swipe target** — a full swipe must trigger the
destructive default (which still confirms via the dialog), never Rename (Mail-style layout).
Leading swipe (Pin) unchanged. The context menu always offers BOTH Archive and Delete
(Delete capability-gated) regardless of the swipe pref. In the archived sheet Delete is
likewise listed first (full-swipe deletes, immediately).

**Rows are natural-height — no min-height floor**: a one-line row lands around ~44pt total,
and its trailing swipe buttons render as iOS's compact text capsules (the icon-over-label
style needs a taller row). A content floor was tried twice for #73 — 48pt (~70pt cells) and
then 44pt (+20pt over natural, shipped to TestFlight in `df56ca0`) — and **reverted both
times** (#79: testers reported the list "way too high"). The compact list is worth more than
the fuller swipe-button style; the swipe buttons are plain `Button`s, so nothing else keys off
the row height. Don't reintroduce a floor (or a density setting — considered and declined in
#79) for the swipe-button rendering without revisiting that trade-off.

**Confirmations present via `BottomActionSheet`, not `.confirmationDialog`**: on iOS 26 no
system presentation docks at the bottom any more — SwiftUI's `confirmationDialog` renders as a
floating popover anchored to whatever view carries the modifier, **dropping the title and the
Cancel button** (FB20644893); UIKit's `UIAlertController(.actionSheet)` anchors to any popover
`sourceView` the same way and presents CENTERED without one. So `BottomActionSheet.swift`
renders the same reducer-owned `ConfirmationDialogState` in a height-fitted SwiftUI sheet
(content-measured detent, destructive button styled red) — **the state model and every reducer
test against it are untouched**; only the presentation layer differs, and it behaves
identically on iOS 18. Keep raising dialogs through `ConfirmationDialogState`; present them
with `.bottomActionSheet($store.scope(...))`.
